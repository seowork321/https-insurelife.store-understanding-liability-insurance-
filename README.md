Liability insurance is a type of coverage that protects you if youâ€™re held responsible for causing injury or damage to someone else. It covers legal fees, medical expenses, and repair costs, saving you from paying out of pocket. This insurance is a key component of many policies, including auto, home, and business insurance.
